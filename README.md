Hi, I'm Priyem 👋

I build human-centered AI products and lead programs that turn ideas into scalable, real-world solutions. With experience across engineering, product leadership and program management, I connect technology, operations, and customer needs to drive meaningful, measurable outcomes. My work sits at the intersection of product strategy, program execution, and applied AI: turning vision into roadmaps, leading multi-team initiatives, and delivering products that balance innovation with business priorities.

I focus on practical leadership: building frameworks, executable plans, and repeatable patterns that enable teams to move faster and smarter.

🔧 What I Focus On

Product Strategy → Execution — Turning vision into roadmaps and ensuring teams deliver outcomes, not just output.
Program Leadership — Driving cross-functional initiatives across product, engineering, design, data, and go-to-market teams.
Human-Centered AI — Designing AI solutions that enhance workflows and support human judgment.
Frameworks & Playbooks — Creating discovery frameworks, prioritization models, and program playbooks for AI-driven teams.
💬 If you’re building something that requires strategic clarity, operational excellence, and human-centered AI thinking, let’s connect.
